# AfterRefactoring# Dealership calculator

Today we'll be building a system that will assist a vehicle dealership to
calculate prices when a user wants to buy/lease a car.
A dealership can also buy vehicles from customers.


There are three types of vehicles in the dealership: 'Car', 'Truck' and 'Motorcycle'.
All these vehicles have the same attributes: 'maker', 'model', 'year', 'base_price'


There are two types of customers (both extending the class 'Person'): 'Customer' and 'Employee'.
An Employee can decide to buy a car from the dealership, and she/he will have a discount.

A dealership can either buy or sell vehicles.

A customer can either buy or lease a car.
