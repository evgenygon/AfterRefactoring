# AfterRefactoring# Dealership calculator

Today we'll be building a system that will assist a vehicle dealership to
calculate prices when a user wants to buy/lease a car.
A dealership can also buy vehicles from customers.
There are three types of vehicles in the dealership: 'Car', 'Truck' & 'Motorcycle'.
There are two types of customers : Customer & Employee.
An Employee can decide to buy a car from the dealership, and she/he will have a discount.
A dealership can either buy or sell vehicles.
A customer can either buy or lease a car.
