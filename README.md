# AfterRefactoring# Dealership calculator

Today we'll be building a system that will assist a vehicle dealership to
calculate prices when a user wants to buy/lease a car.

A dealership can also buy vehicles from customers.

There are three types of vehicles in the dealership: 

1. 'Car'
2. 'Truck'
3. 'Motorcycle'

There are two types of customers : Customer & Employee.

An Employee can decide to buy a car from the dealership, and she/he will have a discount.

A dealership can either buy or sell vehicles.

A customer can either buy or lease a car.
